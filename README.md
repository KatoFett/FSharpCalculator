# Overview

The purpose of this program is to learn and test the F# programming language. This program is beyond rudimentary, but works.

The calculator accepts and parses an expression string, e.g 1+2*3-4, follows order of operations, and returns the calculated value: 3. It supports the four basic operations as well as parentheses and exponents using ^.
